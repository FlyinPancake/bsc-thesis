# Use-cases for vcluster

This repository contains all the research and results in context with my BSc thesis.

## Directories

- `thesis` contains the source files to build the thesis PDF

## Compiling

### Thesis

There are artefacts with every push on the main branch.

If you want to compile the thesis yourself, you need to have `typst` installed.
Then you can run the following command in the root directory of this repository:

```bash
typst compile thesis/main.typ
```
